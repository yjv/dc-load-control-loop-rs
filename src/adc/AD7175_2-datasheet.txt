The AD7175-2 is a low noise, fast settling, multiplexed, 2-/4channel (fully/pseudo differential) Σ-Δ analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) for low bandwidth inputs. It has a maximum channel
scan rate of 50 kSPS (20 µs) for fully settled data. The output
data rates range from 5 SPS to 250 kSPS.

APPLICATIONS

The device operates with a 5 V AVDD1, or ±2.5 V AVDD1/AVSS,
and 2 V to 5 V AVDD2 and IOVDD supplies. The specified
operating temperature range is −40°C to +105°C. The AD7175-2 is
in a 24-lead TSSOP package.

The AD7175-2 integrates key analog and digital signal conditioning blocks to allow users to configure an individual setup for
each analog input channel in use. Each feature can be user selected
on a per channel basis. Integrated true rail-to-rail buffers on the
analog inputs and external reference inputs provide easy to drive
high impedance inputs. The precision 2.5 V low drift (2 ppm/°C)
band gap internal reference (with output reference buffer) adds
embedded functionality to reduce external component count.
The digital filter allows simultaneous 50 Hz/60 Hz rejection at
27.27 SPS output data rate. The user can switch between
different filter options according to the demands of each
channel in the application. The ADC automatically switches
through each selected channel. Further digital processing
functions include offset and gain calibration registers,
configurable on a per channel basis.

DOUT/RDY returns high after a read of the data register. In single conversion mode and continuous conversion mode, the same data can be read again, if required,
while DOUT/RDY is high, although care must be taken to ensure that subsequent reads do not occur close to the next output update. If the continuous read feature is
enabled, the digital word can be read only once.

Description
Analog Input 4. Selectable through crosspoint multiplexer.
Reference Input Negative Terminal. REF− can span from AVSS to AVDD1 − 1 V.
Reference Input Positive Terminal. An external reference can be applied between REF+ and REF−. REF+
can span from AVSS + 1 V to AVDD1.The device functions with a reference magnitude from 1 V to
AVDD1.
Buffered Output of Internal Reference. The output is 2.5 V with respect to AVSS.
Analog LDO Regulator Output. Decouple this pin to AVSS using a 1 µF and a 0.1 µF capacitor.
Negative Analog Supply. This supply ranges from −2.75 V to 0 V and is nominally set to 0 V.
Analog Supply Voltage 1. This voltage is 5 V ± 10% with respect to AVSS.
Analog Supply Voltage 2. This voltage ranges from 2 V to 5 V with respect to AVSS.
Input 1 for Crystal.
Input 2 for Crystal/Clock Input or Output. Based on the CLOCKSEL bits in the ADCMODE register. There
are four options available for selecting the MCLK source:
Internal oscillator: no output.
Internal oscillator: output to XTAL2/CLKIO. Operates at IOVDD logic level.
External clock: input to XTAL2/CLKIO. Input must be at IOVDD logic level.
External crystal: connected between XTAL1 and XTAL2/CLKIO.
Serial Data Output/Data Ready Output. DOUT/RDY is a dual purpose pin. It functions as a serial data
output pin to access the output shift register of the ADC. The output shift register can contain data
from any of the on-chip data or control registers. The data-word/control word information is placed on
the DOUT/RDY pin on the SCLK falling edge and is valid on the SCLK rising edge. When CS is high, the
DOUT/RDY output is three-stated. When CS is low, DOUT/RDY operates as a data ready pin, going low
to indicate the completion of a conversion. If the data is not read after the conversion, the pin goes
high before the next update occurs. The DOUT/RDY falling edge can be used as an interrupt to a
processor, indicating that valid data is available.
Serial Data Input to the Input Shift Register on the ADC. Data in this shift register is transferred to the
control registers in the ADC, with the register address (RA) bits of the communications register
identifying the appropriate register. Data is clocked in on the rising edge of SCLK.
Serial Clock Input. This serial clock input is for data transfers to and from the ADC. The SCLK has a
Schmitt triggered input, making the interface suitable for opto-isolated applications.
Chip Select Input. This is an active low logic input selects the ADC. CS can select the ADC in systems
with more than one device on the serial bus. CS can be hardwired low, allowing the ADC to operate in 3wire mode with SCLK, DIN, and DOUT used to interface with the device. When CS is high, the
DOUT/RDY output is three-stated.

Description
Synchronization Input/Error Input/Output. This pin can be switched between a logic input and a logic
output in the GPIOCON register. When synchronization input (SYNC) is enabled, this pin allows
synchronization of the digital filters and analog modulators when using multiple AD7175-2 devices.
For more information, see the Synchronization section. When the synchronization input is disabled,
this pin can be used in one of three modes:
Active low error input mode: this mode sets the ADC_ERROR bit in the status register.
Active low, open-drain error output mode: the status register error bits are mapped to the ERROR
output. The SYNC/ERROR pins of multiple devices can be wired together to a common pull-up resistor
so that an error on any device can be observed.
General-purpose output mode: the status of the pin is controlled by the ERR_DAT bit in the GPIOCON
register. The pin is referenced between IOVDD and DGND, as opposed to the AVDD1 and AVSS levels
used by the GPIOx pins. The pin has an active pull-up in this case.
Digital Input/Output Supply Voltage. The IOVDD voltage ranges from 2 V to 5 V. IOVDD is independent
of AVDD2. For example, IOVDD can be operated at 3 V when AVDD2 equals 5 V, or vice versa. If AVSS is
set to −2.5 V, the voltage on IOVDD must not exceed 3.6 V.
Digital Ground.
Digital LDO Regulator Output. This pin is for decoupling purposes only. Decouple this pin to DGND
using a 1 µF and a 0.1 µF capacitor.
General-Purpose Input/Output 0. The pin is referenced between AVDD1 and AVSS levels.
General-Purpose Input/Output 1. The pin is referenced between AVDD1 and AVSS levels.
Analog Input 0. Selectable through the crosspoint multiplexer.
Analog Input 1. Selectable through the crosspoint multiplexer.
Analog Input 2. Selectable through the crosspoint multiplexer.
Analog Input 3. Selectable through the crosspoint multiplexer.

AI is analog input, AO is analog output, DI/O is bidirectional digital input/output, DO is digital output, DI is digital input, and P is power supply.

NOISE PERFORMANCE AND RESOLUTION
Table 6 and Table 7 show the rms noise, peak-to-peak noise,
effective resolution and the noise free (peak-to-peak) resolution
of the AD7175-2 for various output data rates and filters. The
numbers given are for the bipolar input range with an external
5 V reference.

These numbers are typical and are generated with a differential
input voltage of 0 V when the ADC is continuously converting
on a single channel. It is important to note that the peak-topeak resolution is calculated based on the peak-to-peak noise.
The peak-to-peak resolution represents the resolution for which
there is no code flicker.

AD7175-2

Data Sheet

GETTING STARTED
The AD7175-2 includes a precision 2.5 V low drift (±2 ppm/°C)
band gap internal reference. This reference can used for the ADC
conversions, reducing the external component count. Alternatively,
the reference can be output to the REFOUT pin to be used as a
low noise biasing voltage for external circuitry. An example of
this is using the REFOUT signal to set the input common mode
for an external amplifier.

The AD7175-2 offers the user a fast settling, high resolution,
multiplexed ADC with high levels of configurability.

x
x
x

Two fully differential or four single-ended analog inputs.
Crosspoint multiplexer selects any analog input combination as the input signals to be converted, routing them to
the modulator positive or negative input.
True rail-to-rail buffered analog and reference inputs.
Fully differential input or single-ended input relative to any
analog input.
Per channel configurability—up to four different setups can be
defined. A separate setup can be mapped to each of the
channels. Each setup allows the user to configure whether
the buffers are enabled or disabled, gain and offset correction,
filter type, output data rate, and reference source selection
(internal/external).

The AD7175-2 includes two separate linear regulator blocks for
both the analog and digital circuitry. The analog LDO regulates
the AVDD2 supply to 1.8 V, supplying the ADC core. The user
can tie the AVDD1 and AVDD2 supplies together for easiest
connection. If there is already a clean analog supply rail in the
system in the range of 2 V (minimum) to 5.5 V (maximum), the
user can also choose to connect this to the AVDD2 input,
allowing lower power dissipation.

AD7175-2

Data Sheet

The linear regulator for the digital IOVDD supply performs a
similar function, regulating the input voltage applied at the
IOVDD pin to 1.8 V for the internal digital filtering. The serial
interface signals always operate from the IOVDD supply seen at
the pin. This means that if 3.3 V is applied to the IOVDD pin,
the interface logic inputs and outputs operate at this level.
The AD7175-2 can be used across a wide variety of applications,
providing high resolution and accuracy. A sample of these
scenarios is as follows:

Accessing the ADC Register Map
The communications register controls access to the full register
map of the ADC. This register is an 8-bit write only register. On
power-up or after a reset, the digital interface defaults to a state
where it is expecting a write to the communications register;
therefore, all communication begins by writing to the
communications register.
The data written to the communications register determines
which register is being accessed and if the next operation is a
read or write. The register address bits (RA[5:0]) determine the
specific register to which the read or write operation applies.
When the read or write operation to the selected register is
complete, the interface returns to the default state, where it
expects a write operation to the communications register.

POWER SUPPLIES
The AD7175-2 has three independent power supply pins:
AVDD1, AVDD2, and IOVDD.
AVDD1 powers the crosspoint multiplexer and integrated analog
and reference input buffers. AVDD1 is referenced to AVSS, and
AVDD1 − AVSS = 5 V only. This can be a single 5 V supply or a
±2.5 V split supply. The split supply operation allows true bipolar
inputs. When using split supplies, consider the absolute maximum
ratings (see the Absolute Maximum Ratings section).

Figure 46 and Figure 47 illustrate writing to and reading from a
register by first writing the 8-bit command to the communications
register, followed by the data for that register.

The AD7175-2 has a 3- or 4-wire SPI interface that is compatible
with QSPI™, MICROWIRE®, and DSPs. The interface operates
in SPI Mode 3 and can be operated with CS tied low. In SPI
Mode 3, the SCLK idles high, the falling edge of SCLK is the
drive edge, and the rising edge of SCLK is the sample edge. This
means that data is clocked out on the falling/drive edge and data
is clocked in on the rising/sample edge.

Figure 48 shows an overview of the suggested flow for changing
the ADC configuration, divided into the following three blocks:

Reading the ID register is the recommended method for verifying
correct communication with the device. The ID register is a
read only register and contains the value 0x0CDX for the
AD7175-2. The communications register and the ID register
details are described in Table 8 and Table 9.

AD7175-2 RESET
In situations where interface synchronization is lost, a write
operation of at least 64 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns the
ADC to the default state by resetting the entire device, including
the register contents. Alternatively, if CS is being used with the
digital interface, returning CS high sets the digital interface to
the default state and halts any serial interface operation.

Channel Configuration
The AD7175-2 has four independent channels and four independent setups. The user can select any of the analog input pairs on
any channel, as well as any of the four setups for any channel,
giving the user full flexibility in the channel configuration. This
also allows per channel configuration when using differential
inputs and single-ended inputs because each channel can have a
dedicated setup.

ADC Setups

Setup Configuration Registers

The AD7175-2 has four independent setups. Each setup consists
of the following four registers:

The setup configuration registers allow the user to select the output
coding of the ADC by selecting between bipolar and unipolar. In
bipolar mode, the ADC accepts negative differential input voltages,
and the output coding is offset binary. In unipolar mode, the ADC
accepts only positive differential voltages, and the coding is straight
binary. In either case, the input voltage must be within the AVDD1/
AVSS supply voltages. The user can select the reference source
using this register. Three options are available: an internal 2.5 V
reference, an external reference connected between the REF+
and REF− pins, or AVDD1 − AVSS. The analog input and
reference input buffers can also be enabled or disabled using
this register.

AD7175-2

Gain Registers

ADC Mode and Interface Mode Configuration

The gain register is a 24-bit register that holds the gain
calibration coefficient for the ADC. The gain registers are
read/write registers. These registers are configured at power-on
with factory calibrated coefficients. Therefore, every device has
different default coefficients. The default value is automatically
overwritten if a system full-scale calibration is initiated by the
user or if the gain register is written to by the user. For more
information on calibration, see the Operating Modes section.

The ADC mode register and the interface mode register configure
the core peripherals for use by the AD7175-2 and the mode for
the digital interface.

ADC Mode Register
The ADC mode register is used primarily to set the conversion
mode of the ADC to either continuous or single conversion.
The user can also select the standby and power-down modes,
as well as any of the calibration modes. In addition, this register
contains the clock source select bits and the internal reference
enable bits. The reference select bits are contained in the setup
configuration registers (see the ADC Setups section for more
information).

Offset Registers
The offset register holds the offset calibration coefficient for the
ADC. The power-on reset value of the offset register is 0x800000.
The offset register is a 24-bit read/write register. The power-on
reset value is automatically overwritten if an internal or system
zero-scale calibration is initiated by the user or if the offset register
is written to by the user.

Interface Mode Register
The interface mode register configures the digital interface
operation. This register allows the user to control data-word
length, CRC enable, data plus status read, and continuous read
mode. The details of both registers are shown in Table 15 and
Table 16. For more information, see the Digital Interface section.

Understanding Configuration Flexibility
The most straightforward implementation of the AD7175-2 is
to use two differential inputs with adjacent analog inputs and
run both of them with the same setup, gain correction, and offset
correction register. In this case, the user selects the following
differential inputs: AIN0/AIN1 and AIN2/AIN3. In Figure 50,
the registers shown in black font must be programmed for such
a configuration. The registers that are shown in gray font are
redundant in this configuration.
CHANNEL
REGISTERS

SETUP CONFIG
REGISTERS

Programming the gain and offset registers is optional for any use
case, as indicated by the dashed lines between the register blocks.
An alternative way to implement these two fully differential
inputs is by taking advantage of the four available setups.
Motivation for doing this includes having a different speed/noise
requirement on each of the differential inputs, or there may be a
specific offset or gain correction for each channel. Figure 51
shows how each of the differential inputs can use a separate
setup, allowing full flexibility in the configuration of each channel.

Figure 52 shows an example of how the channel registers span
between the analog input pins and the setup configurations
downstream. In this example, one differential input and two singleended inputs are required. The single-ended inputs are the AIN2/
AIN4 and AIN3/AIN4 combinations. The differential input pairs
is AIN0/AIN1and uses Setup 0. The two single-ended input pairs
are set up as diagnostics; therefore, use a separate setup from the
differential input but share a setup between them, Setup 1.
Given that two setups are selected for use, the SETUPCON0

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
AVDD1

BUFFERED ANALOG INPUT
The AD7175-2 has true rail-to-rail, integrated, precision unity
gain buffers on both ADC analog inputs. The buffers provide
the benefit of giving the user high input impedance with only
30 nA typical input current, allowing high impedance sources
to be connected directly to the analog inputs. The buffers fully
drive the internal ADC switch capacitor sampling network,
simplifying the analog front-end circuit requirements while
consuming a very efficient 2.9 mA typical per buffer. Each analog
input buffer amplifier is fully chopped, meaning that it minimizes
the offset error drift and 1/f noise of the buffer. The 1/f noise
profile of the ADC and buffer combined is shown in Figure 53.

Figure 53. Shorted Input FFT (Analog Input Buffers Enabled)

The analog input buffers do not suffer from linearity
degradation when operating at the rails, unlike many discrete
amplifiers. When operating at or close to the AVDD1 and AVSS
supply rails, there is an increase in input current. This increase
is most notable at higher temperatures. Figure 42 and Figure 43
show the input current for various conditions. With the analog
input buffers disabled, the average input current to the AD7175-2
changes linearly with the differential input voltage at a rate of
48 µA/V.

CROSSPOINT MULTIPLEXER
There are five analog input pins: AIN0, AIN1, AIN2, AIN3, and
AIN4. Each of these pins connects to the internal crosspoint
multiplexer. The crosspoint multiplexer enables any of these inputs
to be configured as an input pair, either single-ended or fully
differential. The AD7175-2 can have up to four active channels.
When more than one channel is enabled, the channels are
automatically sequenced in order from the lowest enabled channel
number to the highest enabled channel number. The output of
the multiplexer is connected to the input of the integrated true
rail-to-rail buffers. These can be bypassed and the multiplexer
output can be directly connected to the switched-capacitor input
of the ADC. The simplified analog input circuit is shown in
Figure 54.

Because the AIN0 to AIN4 analog inputs are connected to a
crosspoint multiplexer, any combination of signals can create an
analog input pair. This allows the user to select two fully
differential inputs or four single-ended inputs.
If two fully differential input paths are connected to the AD7175-2,
using AIN0/AIN1 as one differential input pair and AIN2/AIN3
as the second differential input pair is recommended. This is
due to the relative locations of these pins to each other. Decouple all
analog inputs to AVSS.

Single-Ended Inputs
The user can also choose to measure four different single-ended
analog inputs. In this case, each of the analog inputs is converted
as the difference between the single-ended input to be
measured and a set analog input common pin. Because there is
a crosspoint multiplexer, the user can set any of the analog inputs
as the common pin. An example of such a scenario is to connect
the AIN4 pin to AVSS or to the REFOUT voltage (that is, AVSS
+ 2.5 V) and select this input when configuring the crosspoint
multiplexer. When using the AD7175-2 with single-ended
inputs, the INL specification is degraded.

AD7175-2 REFERENCE

The output is then connected to a 4.7 µF capacitor, which acts
as a reservoir for any dynamic charge required by the ADC, and
followed by a 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor at the REF+ input.
This capacitor is placed as close as possible to the REF+ and
REF− pins. The REF− pin is connected directly to the AVSS
potential. On power-up of the AD7175-2, the internal reference
is enabled by default and is output on the REFOUT pin. When
an external reference is used instead of the internal reference to
supply the AD7175-2, attention must be paid to the output of
the REFOUT pin. If the internal reference is not being used
elsewhere in the application, ensure that the REFOUT pin is not
hardwired to AVSS because this draws a large current on powerup. On power-up, if the internal reference is not being used,
write to the ADC mode register, disabling the internal
reference. This is controlled by the REF_EN bit (Bit 15) in the
ADC mode register, which is shown in Table 18.

The AD7175-2 offers the user the option of either supplying an
external reference to the REF+ and REF− pins of the device or
allowing the use of the internal 2.5 V, low noise, low drift reference.
Select the reference source to be used by the analog input by setting
the REF_SELx bits (Bits[5:4]) in the setup configuration registers
appropriately. The structure of the Setup Configuration 0 register
is shown in Table 17. The AD7175-2 defaults on power-up to
use the internal 2.5 V reference.

External Reference
The AD7175-2 has a fully differential reference input applied
through the REF+ and REF− pins. Standard low noise, low drift
voltage references, such as the ADR445, ADR444, and ADR441,
are recommended for use. Apply the external reference to the
AD7175-2 reference pins as shown in Figure 55. Decouple the
output of any external reference to AVSS. As shown in Figure 55,
the ADR445 output is decoupled with a 0.1 µF capacitor at the
output for stability purposes.

Data Sheet

Internal Reference
The AD7175-2 includes a low noise, low drift voltage reference.
The internal reference has a 2.5 V output. The internal reference is
output on the REFOUT pin after the REF_EN bit in the ADC
mode register is set and is decoupled to AVSS with a 0.1 µF
capacitor. The AD7175-2 internal reference is enabled by default on
power-up and is selected as the reference source for the ADC.
When using the internal reference, the INL performance is
degraded as shown in Figure 23.
The REFOUT signal is buffered before being output to the pin.
The signal can be used externally in the circuit as a common-mode
source for external amplifier configurations.

BUFFERED REFERENCE INPUT
The AD7175-2 has true rail-to-rail, integrated, precision unity
gain buffers on both ADC reference inputs. The buffers provide
the benefit of giving the user high input impedance and allow
high impedance external sources to be directly connected to the
reference inputs. The integrated reference buffers can fully drive
the internal reference switch capacitor sampling network,
simplifying the reference circuit requirements while consuming
a very efficient 2.9 mA typical per buffer. Each reference input
buffer amplifier is fully chopped, meaning that it minimizes the
offset error drift and 1/f noise of the buffer. When using an
external reference, such as the ADR445, ADR444, and ADR441,
these buffers are not required because these references, with
proper decoupling, can drive the reference inputs directly.

the IOVDD logic level. Use of this option can affect the dc
performance of the AD7175-2 due to the disturbance introduced
by the output driver. The extent to which the performance is
affected depends on the IOVDD voltage supply. Higher IOVDD
voltages create a wider logic output swing from the driver and
affect performance to a greater extent. This effect is further
exaggerated if the IOSTRENGTH bit is set at higher IOVDD
levels (see Table 28 for more information).

External Crystal
If higher precision, lower jitter clock sources are required, the
AD7175-2 can use an external crystal to generate the master
clock. The crystal is connected to the XTAL1 and
XTAL2/CLKIO pins. A recommended crystal for use is the FA20H—a 16 MHz, 10 ppm, 9 pF crystal from Epson-Toyocom—
which is available in a surface-mount package. As shown in
Figure 56, insert two capacitors from the traces connecting the
crystal to the XTAL1 and XTAL2/CLKIO pins. These capacitors
allow for circuit tuning. Connect these capacitors to the DGND
pin. The value for these capacitors depends on the length and
capacitance of the trace connections between the crystal and the
XTAL1 and XTAL2/CLKIO pins. Therefore, the values of these
capacitors differ depending on the printed circuit board (PCB)
layout and the crystal employed.

All output data rates listed in the data sheet relate to a master
clock rate of 16 MHz. Using a lower clock frequency from, for
instance, an external source scales any listed data rate
proportionally. To achieve the specified data rates, particularly
rates for rejection of 50 Hz and 60 Hz, use a 16 MHz clock. The
source of the master clock is selected by setting the CLOCKSEL
bits (Bits[3:2]) in the ADC mode register as shown in Table 18.
The default operation on power-up and reset of the AD7175-2
is to operate with the internal oscillator. It is possible to fine
tune the output data rate and filter notch at low output data
rates using the SINC3_MAPx bit. See the Sinc3 Filter section
for more information.

Internal Oscillator
The internal oscillator runs at 16 MHz and can be used as the
ADC master clock. It is the default clock source for the AD7175-2
and is specified with an accuracy of ±2.5%.
There is an option to allow the internal clock oscillator to be
output on the XTAL2/CLKIO pin. The clock output is driven to

The external crystal circuitry can be sensitive to the SCLK
edges, depending on SCLK frequency, IOVDD voltage, crystal
circuitry layout, and the crystal used. During crystal startup, any
disturbances caused by the SCLK edges may cause double edges
on the crystal input, resulting in invalid conversions until the
crystal voltage has reached a high enough level such that any
interference from the SCLK edges is insufficient to cause double
clocking. This double clocking can be avoided by ensuring that
the crystal circuitry has reached a sufficient voltage level after
startup before applying any SCLK.
Due to the nature of the crystal circuitry, it is therefore
recommended that empirical testing of the circuit b performed
under the required conditions, with the final PCB layout and
crystal, to ensure correct operation.

External Clock
The AD7175-2 can also use an externally supplied clock. In
systems where this is desirable, the external clock is routed to
the XTAL2/CLKIO pin. In this configuration, the
XTAL2/CLKIO pin accepts the externally sourced clock and
routes it to the modulator. The logic level of this clock input is
defined by the voltage applied to the IOVDD pin.

The output data rates with the accompanying settling time and

is possible to finely tune the output data rate for the sinc3 filter by
setting the SINC3_MAPx bit in the filter configuration registers.
If this bit is set, the mapping of the filter register changes to directly
program the decimation rate of the sinc3 filter. All other options
are eliminated. The data rate when on a single channel can be
calculated using the following equation:

Data Sheet

The AD7175-2 can be configured by setting the SING_CYC bit
in the ADC mode register so that only fully settled data is output,
thus effectively putting the ADC into a single cycle settling mode.
This mode achieves single cycle settling by reducing the output
data rate to be equal to the settling time of the ADC for the selected
output data rate. This bit has no effect with the sinc5 + sinc1
filter at output data rates of 10 kSPS and lower.

Figure 61 shows the same step on the analog input but with
single cycle settling enabled. The analog input requires at least a
single cycle for the output to be fully settled. The output data
rate, as indicated by the RDY signal, is now reduced to equal the
settling time of the filter at the selected output data rate.

ENHANCED 50 HZ AND 60 HZ REJECTION FILTERS
The enhanced filters are designed to provide rejection of 50 Hz
and 60 Hz simultaneously and to allow the user to trade off
settling time and rejection. These filters can operate up to
27.27 SPS or can reject up to 90 dB of 50 Hz ± 1 Hz and 60 Hz
± 1 Hz interference. These filters are realized by postfiltering
the output of the sinc5 + sinc1 filter. For this reason, the sinc5 +

sinc1 filter must be selected when using the enhanced filters to
achieve the specified settling time and noise performance. Table 23
shows the output data rates with the accompanying settling
time, rejection, and rms noise. Figure 62 to Figure 69 show the
frequency domain plots of the responses from the enhanced filters.

AD7175-2

OPERATING MODES
The AD7175-2 has a number of operating modes that can be set
from the ADC mode register and interface mode register (see
Table 27 and Table 28). These modes are as follows and are
described in the following paragraphs:
x
x
x
x
x
x

Continuous conversion mode
Continuous read mode
Single conversion mode
Standby mode
Power-down mode
Calibration modes (three)

CONTINUOUS CONVERSION MODE
Continuous conversion is the default power-up mode. The
AD7175-2 converts continuously, and the RDY bit in the status
register goes low each time a conversion is complete. If CS is low,
the RDY output also goes low when a conversion is complete. To
read a conversion, the user writes to the communications
register, indicating that the next operation is a read of the data
register.

When the data-word has been read from the data register, the
DOUT/RDY pin goes high. The user can read this register
additional times, if required. However, the user must ensure that
the data register is not being accessed at the completion of the
next conversion; otherwise, the new conversion word is lost.
When several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically
sequences through the enabled channels, performing one
conversion on each channel. When all channels have been
converted, the sequence starts again with the first channel. The
channels are converted in order from lowest enabled channel to
highest enabled channel. The data register is updated as soon as
each conversion is available. The RDY output pulses low each
time a conversion is available. The user can then read the
conversion while the ADC converts the next enabled channel.
If the DATA_STAT bit in the interface mode register is set to 1,
the contents of the status register, along with the conversion data,
are output each time the data register is read. The status register
indicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.

CONTINUOUS READ MODE

To enable continuous read mode, set the CONTREAD bit in the
interface mode register. When this bit is set, the only serial interface
operations possible are reads from the data register. To exit continuous read mode, issue a dummy read of the ADC data register
command (0x44) while the RDY output is low. Alternatively, apply
a software reset, that is, 64 SCLKs with CS = 0 and DIN = 1.
This resets the ADC and all register contents. These are the only
commands that the interface recognizes after it is placed in
continuous read mode. Hold DIN low in continuous read mode
until an instruction is to be written to the device.

In continuous read mode, it is not required to write to the
communications register before reading ADC data; apply only
the required number of SCLKs after RDY goes low to indicate
the end of a conversion. When the conversion is read, RDY
returns high until the next conversion is available. In this mode,
the data can be read only once. The user must also ensure that
the data-word is read before the next conversion is complete. If
the user has not read the conversion before the completion of
the next conversion or if insufficient serial clocks are applied to
the AD7175-2 to read the data word, the serial output register is
reset shortly before the next conversion is complete, and the
new conversion is placed in the output serial register. The ADC
must be configured for continuous conversion mode to use
continuous read mode.

If multiple ADC channels are enabled, each channel is output
in turn, with the status bits being appended to the data if
DATA_STAT is set in the interface mode register. The status
register indicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.

SINGLE CONVERSION MODE
In single conversion mode, the AD7175-2 performs a single
conversion and is placed in standby mode after the conversion
is complete. The RDY output goes low to indicate the completion
of a conversion. When the data-word has been read from the
data register, DOUT/RDY pin goes high. The data register can
be read several times, if required, even when DOUT/RDY pin has
gone high.
If several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically
sequences through the enabled channels and performs a
conversion on each channel. When a conversion is started, the
DOUT/RDY pin goes high and remains high until a valid
conversion is available and CS is low.

As soon as the conversion is available, the RDY output goes low.
The ADC then selects the next channel and begins a conversion.
The user can read the present conversion while the next
conversion is being performed. As soon as the next conversion is
complete, the data register is updated; therefore, the user has a
limited period in which to read the conversion. When the ADC
has performed a single conversion on each of the selected
channels, it returns to standby mode.
If the DATA_STAT bit in the interface mode register is set to 1,
the contents of the status register, along with the conversion, are
output each time the data register is read. The two LSBs of the
status register indicate the channel to which the conversion
corresponds.

STANDBY AND POWER-DOWN MODES
In standby mode, most blocks are powered down. The LDOs
remain active so that registers maintain their contents. The
internal reference remains active if enabled, and the crystal
oscillator remains active if selected. To power down the
reference in standby mode, set the REF_EN bit in the ADC
mode regsiter to 0. To power down the clock in standby mode,
set the CLOCKSEL bits in the ADC mode register to 00
(internal oscillator).
In power-down mode, all blocks are powered down, including
the LDOs. All registers lose their contents, and the GPIO outputs
are placed in three-state. To prevent accidental entry to powerdown mode, the ADC must first be placed in standby mode.
Exiting power-down mode requires 64 SCLKs with CS = 0 and
DIN = 1, that is, a serial interface reset. A delay of 500 µs is
recommended before issuing a subsequent serial interface
command to allow the LDO to power up.
Figure 19 shows the internal reference settling time after
returning from standby mode (setting REF_EN = 0 and then 1)
and returning from power down.

CALIBRATION
The AD7175-2 allows a two-point calibration to be performed
to eliminate any offset and gain errors. Three calibration modes
eliminate these offset and gain errors on a per setup basis:
x
x
x

Internal zero-scale calibration mode
System zero-scale calibration mode
System full-scale calibration mode

There is no internal full-scale calibration mode bcause this is
calibrated in the factory at the time of production.
Only one channel can be active during calibration. After each
conversion, the ADC conversion result is scaled using the ADC
calibration registers before being written to the data register.
The default value of the offset register is 0x800000, and the
nominal value of the gain register is 0x555555. The calibration
range of the ADC gain is from 0.4 × VREF to 1.05 × VREF. The
following equations show the calculations that are used. In
unipolar mode, the ideal relationship—that is, not taking into
account the ADC gain error and offset error—is as follows:

To start a calibration, write the relevant value to the mode bits
in the ADC mode register. The DOUT/RDY pin and the RDY
bit in the status register go high when the calibration initiates.
When the calibration is complete, the contents of the corresponding offset or gain register are updated, the RDY bit in the
status register is reset and the RDY output pin returns low (if CS
is low), and the AD7175-2 reverts to standby mode.
During an internal offset calibration, the selected positive analog
input pin is disconnected, and both modulator inputs are
connected internally to the selected negative analog input pin.
For this reason, it is necessary to ensure that the voltage on the
selected negative analog input pin does not exceed the allowed
limits and is free from excessive noise and interference.
System calibrations, however, expect the system zero-scale
(offset) and system full-scale (gain) voltages to be applied to the
ADC pins before initiating the calibration modes. As a result,
errors external to the ADC are removed.
From an operational point of view, treat a calibration like
another ADC conversion. An offset calibration, if required,
must always be performed before a full-scale calibration. Set the
system software to monitor the RDY bit in the status register or
the RDY output to determine the end of a calibration via a
polling sequence or an interrupt-driven routine. All calibrations
require a time equal to the settling time of the selected filter and
output data rate to be completed.
An internal offset calibration, system zero-scale calibration, and
system full-scale calibration can be performed at any output data
rate. Using lower output data rates results in better calibration
accuracy and is accurate for all output data rates. A new offset
calibration is required for a given channel if the reference source
for that channel is changed.
The offset error is typically ±40 µV and an offset calibration
reduces the offset error to the order of the noise. The gain error
is factory calibrated at ambient temperature. Following this
calibration, the gain error is typically ±35 ppm of FSR.
The AD7175-2 provides the user with access to the on-chip
calibration registers, allowing the microprocessor to read the
calibration coefficients of the device and to write a calibration
coefficients. A read or write of the offset and gain registers can be
performed at any time except during an internal or self calibration.

DIGITAL INTERFACE

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show timing diagrams for interfacing to
the AD7175-2 using CS to decode the device. Figure 2 shows
the timing for a read operation from the AD7175-2, and Figure 3
shows the timing for a write operation to the AD7175-2. It is
possible to read from the data register several times even though
the RDY output returns high after the first read operation.
However, care must be taken to ensure that the read operations are
completed before the next output update occurs. In continuous
read mode, the data register can be read only once.
The serial interface can operate in 3-wire mode by tying CS low.
In this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/RDY pins communicate
with the AD7175-2. The end of the conversion can also be
monitored using the RDY bit in the status register.
The AD7175-2 can be reset by writing 64 SCLKs with CS = 0
and DIN = 1. A reset returns the interface to the state in which it
expects a write to the communications register. This operation
resets the contents of all registers to their power-on values.
Following a reset, allow a period of 500 µs before addressing the
serial interface.

x8 + x2 + x + 1
During read operations, the user can select between this
polynomial and a simpler XOR function. The XOR function
requires less time to process on the host microcontroller than
the polynomial-based checksum. The CRC_EN bits in the
interface mode register enable and disable the checksum and
allow the user to select between the polynomial check and the
simple XOR check.
The checksum is appended to the end of each read and write
transaction. The checksum calculation for the write transaction
is calculated using the 8-bit command word and the 8-bit to
24-bit data. For a read transaction, the checksum is calculated
using the command word and the 8-bit to 32-bit data output.
Figure 73 and Figure 74 show SPI write and read transactions,
respectively.

The DOUT/RDY pin also functions as a data ready signal, with
the output going low if CS is low when a new data-word is
available in the data register. The RDY output is reset high when
a read operation from the data register is complete. The RDY
output also goes high before updating the data register to
indicate when not to read from the device to ensure that a data
read is not attempted while the register is being updated. Take
care to avoid reading from the data register when the RDY
output is about to go low. The best method to ensure that no data
read occurs is to always monitor the RDY output; start reading
the data register as soon as the RDY output goes low; and
ensure a sufficient SCLK rate, such that the read is completed
before the next conversion result. CS selects a device. It can decode
the AD7175-2 in systems where several components are
connected to the serial bus.

For CRC checksum calculations during a write operation, the
following polynomial is always used:

The programmable functions of the AD7175-2 are controlled via
the SPI serial interface. The serial interface of the AD7175-2
consists of four signals: CS, DIN, SCLK, and DOUT/RDY. The
DIN input transfers data into the on-chip registers, and DOUT
output accesses data from the on-chip registers. SCLK is the serial
clock input for the device, and all data transfers (either on DIN
input or on DOUT output) occur with respect to the SCLK
signal.

Figure 74. SPI Read Transaction with CRC

If checksum protection is enabled when continuous read mode
is active, an implied read data command of 0x44 before every
data transmission must be accounted for when calculating the
checksum value. This implied read data command ensures a
nonzero checksum value even if the ADC data equals 0x000000.

CHECKSUM PROTECTION
The AD7175-2 has a checksum mode that can improve
interface robustness. Using the checksum ensures that only
valid data is written to a register and allows data read from a
register to be validated. If an error occurs during a register
write, the CRC_ERROR bit is set in the status register. However,
to ensure that the register write was successful, read back the
register and verify the checksum.

CRC CALCULATION
Polynomial
The checksum, which is eight bits wide, is generated using the
polynomial
x8 + x2 + x + 1

An XOR (exclusive OR) function is applied to the data to
produce a new, shorter number. The polynomial is again aligned
so that the MSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the new result,
and the procedure is repeated. This process repeats until the
original data is reduced to a value less than the polynomial.
This is the 8-bit checksum.

To generate the checksum, the data is left shifted by eight bits to
create a number ending in eight Logic 0s. The polynomial is
aligned so that the MSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the
data.

INTEGRATED FUNCTIONS
The AD7175-2 has integrated functions that improve the
usefulness of a number of applications as well as serve
diagnostic purposes in safety conscious applications.

GENERAL-PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT
The AD7175-2 has two general-purpose digital input/output pins:
GPIO0 and GPIO1. They are enabled using the IP_EN0/IP_EN1
bits or the OP_EN0/OP_EN1 bits in the GPIOCON register. When
the GPIO0 or GPIO1 pin is enabled as an input, the logic level at
the pin is contained in the GP_DATA0 or GP_DATA1 bit,
respectively. When the GPIO0 or GPIO1 pin is enabled as an
output, the GP_ DATA0 or GP_DATA1 bits, respectively,
determine the logic level output at the pin. The logic levels for
these pins are referenced to AVDD1 and AVSS; therefore, outputs
have an amplitude of 5 V.
The SYNC/ERROR pin can also be used as a general-purpose
output. When ERR_EN bits in the GPIOCON register are set to
11, the SYNC/ERROR pin operates as a general-purpose output.
In this configuration, the ERR_DAT bit in the GPIOCON register
determines the logic level output at the pin. The logic level for the
pin is referenced to IOVDD and DGND.
Both GPIOs and the SYNC/ERROR pin, when set as generalpurpose outputs, have an active pull-up.

The effect on the noise performance depends on the delay time
compared to the conversion time. It is possible to absorb the delay
only for output data rates less than 10 kSPS with the exception
of the following four rates, which cannot absorb any delay:
397.5 SPS, 59.92 SPS, 49.96 SPS, and 16.66 SPS.

16-BIT/24-BIT CONVERSIONS
By default, the AD7175-2 generates 24-bit conversions.
However, the width of the conversions can be reduced to 16 bits.
Setting the WL16 bit in the interface mode register to 1 rounds
all data conversions to 16 bits. Clearing this bit sets the width of
the data conversions to 24 bits.

DOUT_RESET
The serial interface uses a shared DOUT/RDY pin. By default,
this pin outputs the RDY signal. During a data read, this pin
outputs the data from the register being read. After the read is
complete, the pin reverts to outputting the RDY signal after a
short fixed period of time (t7). However, this time may be too
short for some microcontrollers and can be extended until the
CS pin is brought high by setting the DOUT_RESET bit in the
interface mode register to 1. This means that CS must frame
each read operation and compete the serial interface transaction.

SYNCHRONIZATION

EXTERNAL MULTIPLEXER CONTROL

Normal Synchronization

If an external multiplexer increases the channel count, the
multiplexer logic pins can be controlled via the AD7175-2
GPIOx pins. With the MUX_IO bit, the GPIOx timing is
controlled by the ADC; therefore, the channel change is
synchronized with the ADC, eliminating any need for external
synchronization.

DELAY
It is possible to insert a programmable delay before the AD7175-2
begins to take samples. This delay allows an external amplifier
or multiplexer to settle and can also alleviate the specification
requirements for the external amplifier or multiplexer. Eight
programmable settings, ranging from 0 µs to 1 ms, can be set
using the delay bits in the ADC mode register (Register 0x01,
Bits[10:8]).
If a delay greater than 0 µs is selected and the HIDE_DELAY bit
in the ADC mode register is set to 0, this delay is added to the
conversion time, regardless of selected output data rate.
When using the sinc5 + sinc1 filter, it is possible to hide this
delay such that the output data rate remains the same as the output
data rate without the delay enabled. If the HIDE_DELAY bit is
set to 1 and the selected delay is less than half of the conversion
time, the delay can be absorbed by reducing the number of
averages the digital filter performs, which keeps the conversion
time the same but can affect the noise performance.

When the SYNC_EN bit in the GPIOCON register is set to 1,
the SYNC/ERROR pin functions as a synchronization input.
The SYNC input lets the user reset the modulator and the
digital filter without affecting any of the setup conditions on the
device. This feature lets the user start to gather samples of the
analog input from a known point, the rising edge of the SYNC
input. The SYNC input must be low for at least one master
clock cycle to ensure that synchronization occurs.
If multiple AD7175-2 devices are operated from a common
master clock, they can be synchronized so that their analog
inputs are sampled simultaneously. This synchronization is
normally done after each AD7175-2 device performs a calibration
or has calibration coefficients loaded into the calibration registers.
A falling edge on the SYNC input resets the digital filter and the
analog modulator and places the AD7175-2 into a consistent
known state. While the SYNC input is low, the AD7175-2 is
maintained in this known state. On the SYNC input rising edge,
the modulator and filter are taken out of this reset state, and on
the next master clock edge, the device starts to gather input
samples again.

Rev. B | Page 46 of 62

Data Sheet

AD7175-2

The device is taken out of reset on the master clock falling edge
following the SYNC input low to high transition. Therefore,
when multiple devices are being synchronized, take the SYNC
input high on the master clock rising edge to ensure that all
devices are released on the master clock falling edge. If the
SYNC input is not taken high in sufficient time, a difference of
one master clock cycle between the devices is possible; that is,
the instant at which conversions are available differs from
device to device by a maximum of one master clock cycle.

CRC_ERROR
If the CRC value that accompanies a write operation does not
correspond with the information sent, the CRC_ERROR flag is
set. The flag is reset as soon as the status register is explicitly read.

REG_ERROR

The SYNC input can also be used as a start conversion
command for a single channel when in normal synchronization
mode. In this mode, the rising edge of SYNC input starts a
conversion, and the falling edge of the RDY output indicates when
the conversion is complete. The settling time of the filter is
required for each data register update. After the conversion is
complete, bring the SYNC input low in preparation for the next
conversion start signal.

The RE_ERROR flag is used in conjunction with the
REG_CHECK bit in the interface mode register. When the
REG_CHECK bit is set, the AD7175-2 monitors the values in
the on-chip registers. If a bit changes, the REG_ERROR bit is
set. Therefore, for writes to the on-chip registers, set REG_CHECK
to 0. When the registers have been updated, the REG_CHECK
bit can be set to 1. The AD7175-2 calculates a checksum of the
on-chip registers. If one of the register values has changed, the
REG_ERROR bit is set. If an error is flagged, the REG_CHECK
bit must be set to 0 to clear the REG_ERROR bit in the status
register. The register check function does not monitor the data
register, status register, or interface mode register.

Alternate Synchronization

ERROR Input/Output

In alternate synchronization mode, the SYNC input operates as
a start conversion command when several channels of the
AD7175-2 are enabled. Setting the ALT_SYNC bit in the interface
mode register to 1 enables an alternate synchronization scheme.
When the SYNC input is taken low, the ADC completes the
conversion on the current channel, selects the next channel in
the sequence, and then waits until the SYNC input is taken high
to commence the conversion. The RDY output goes low when
the conversion is complete on the current channel, and the data
register is updated with the corresponding conversion.
Therefore, the SYNC input does not interfere with the sampling
on the currently selected channel but allows the user to control
the instant at which the conversion begins on the next channel
in the sequence.

When the SYNC_EN bit in the GPIOCON register is set to 0,
the SYNC/ERROR pin functions as an error input/output pin or
a general-purpose output pin. The ERR_EN bits in the GPIOCON
register determine the function of the pin.

Alternate synchronization mode can be used only when several
channels are enabled. It is not recommended to use this mode
when a single channel is enabled.

ERROR FLAGS
The status register contains three error bits—ADC_ERROR,
CRC_ERROR, and REG_ERROR—that flag errors with the
ADC conversion, errors with the CRC check, and errors caused
by changes in the registers, respectively. In addition, the ERROR
output can indicate that an error has occurred.

With ERR_EN is set to 10,the SYNC/ERROR pin functions as
an open-drain error output, ERROR. The three error bits in the
status register (ADC_ERROR, CRC_ERROR, and REG_ERROR)
are OR’ed, inverted, and mapped to the ERROR output. Therefore,
the ERROR output indicates that an error has occurred. The
status register must be read to identify the error source.
When ERR_EN is set to 01, the SYNC/ERROR pin functions as
an error input, ERROR. The error output of another component
can be connected to the AD7175-2 ERROR input so that the
AD7175-2 indicates when an error occurs on either itself or the
external component. The value on the ERROR input is inverted
and OR’ed with the errors from the ADC conversion, and the
result is indicated via the ADC_ERROR bit in the status register.
The value of the ERROR input is reflected in the ERR_DAT bit
in the status register.
The ERROR input/output is disabled when ERR_EN is set to 00.
When the ERR_EN bits are set to 11, the SYNC/ERROR pin
operates as a general-purpose output.

DATA_STAT

ADC_ERROR
The ADC_ERROR bit in the status register flags any errors that
occur during the conversion process. The flag is set when an overrange or underrange result is output from the ADC. The ADC
also outputs all 0s or all 1s when an undervoltage or overvoltage
occurs. This flag is reset only when the overvoltage or undervoltage
is removed. It is not reset by a read of the data register.

The contents of the status register can be appended to each conversion on the AD7175-2. This function is useful if several
channels are enabled. Each time a conversion is output, the
contents of the status register are appended. The two LSBs of
the status register indicate to which channel the conversion
corresponds. In addition, the user can determine if any errors
are being flagged by the error bits.

Data Sheet

IOSTRENGTH
The serial interface can operate with a power supply as low as
2 V. However, at this low voltage, the DOUT/RDY pin may not
have sufficient drive strength if there is moderate parasitic
capacitance on the board or the SCLK frequency is high. The
IOSTRENGTH bit in the interface mode register increases the
drive strength of the DOUT/RDY pin.

INTERNAL TEMPERATURE SENSOR
The AD7175-2 has an integrated temperature sensor. The
temperature sensor can be used as a guide for the ambient
temperature at which the part is operating. This can be used for
diagnostic purposes or as an indicator of when the application
circuit must rerun a calibration routine to take into account a
shift in operating temperature. The temperature sensor is
selected using the crosspoint multiplexer and is selected the
same as an analog input channel.

The temperature sensor requires the analog input buffers be
enabled on both analog inputs. It is recommend that the input
buffers are enabled, but this is not necessary for the
measurement.
To use the temperature sensor, the first step is to calibrate the
device in a known temperature (25°C) and take a conversion as
a reference point. The temperature sensor has a nominal
sensitivity of 470 µV/K; the difference in this ideal slope and the
slope measured can calibrate the temperature sensor. The
temperature sensor is specified with a ±2°C typical accuracy
after calibration at 25°C. The temperature can be calculated as
follows:

AD7175-2

GROUNDING AND LAYOUT
The analog inputs and reference inputs are differential and,
therefore, most of the voltages in the analog modulator are
common-mode voltages. The high common-mode rejection of
the device removes common-mode noise on these inputs. The
analog and digital supplies to the AD7175-2 are independent
and connected to separate pins to minimize coupling between the
analog and digital sections of the device. The digital filter provides
rejection of broadband noise on the power supplies, except at
integer multiples of the master clock frequency.

possible to provide low impedance paths and reduce glitches on
the power supply line. Shield fast switching signals like clocks
with digital ground to prevent radiating noise to other sections
of the board and never run clock signals near the analog inputs.
Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Run traces on
opposite sides of the board at right angles to each other. This
technique reduces the effects of feed through on the board. A
microstrip technique is by far the best but is not always possible
with a double-sided board.

The digital filter also removes noise from the analog and
reference inputs, provided that these noise sources do not
saturate the analog modulator. As a result, the AD7175-2 is
more immune to noise interference than a conventional high
resolution converter. However, because the resolution of the
AD7175-2 is high and the noise levels from the converter are so
low, take care with regard to grounding and layout.

Good decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs.
The AD7175-2 has three power supply pins—AVDD1, AVDD2,
and IOVDD. The AVDD1 and AVDD2 pins are referenced to
AVSS, and the IOVDD pin is referenced to DGND. Decouple
AVDD1 and AVDD2 with a 10 µF capacitor in parallel with a
0.1 µF capacitor to AVSS on each pin. Place the 0.1 µF capacitor
as close as possible to the device on each supply, ideally right up
against the device. Decouple IOVDD with a 10 µF capacitor in
parallel with a 0.1 µF capacitor to DGND. Decouple all analog
inputs to AVSS. If an external reference is used, decouple the
REF+ and REF− pins to AVSS.

The PCB that houses the ADC must be designed such that the
analog and digital sections are separated and confined to
certain areas of the board. A minimum etch technique is
generally best for ground planes because it results in the best
shielding.
In any layout, the user must consider the flow of currents in the
system, ensuring that the paths for all return currents are as close as
possible to the paths the currents took to reach their destinations.
Avoid running digital lines under the device because this
couples noise onto the die and allow the analog ground plane to
run under the AD7175-2 to prevent noise coupling. The power
supply lines to the AD7175-2 must use as wide a trace as

The AD7175-2 also has two on-board LDO regulators—one
that regulates the AVDD2 supply and one that regulates the
IOVDD supply. For the REGCAPA pin, it is recommended that
1 µF and 0.1 µF capacitors to AVSS be used. Similarly, for the
REGCAPD pin, it is recommended that 1 µF and 0.1 µF
capacitors to DGND be used.
If using the AD7175-2 for split supply operation, a separate
plane must be used for AVSS.

Description
The status of RDY is output to the DOUT/RDYpin whenever CS is low and a
register is not being read. This bit goes low when the ADC has written a
new result to the data register. In ADC calibration modes, this bit goes low
when the ADC has written the calibration result. RDY is brought high
automatically by a read of the data register.
New data result available.
Awaiting new data result.
This bit by default indicates if an ADC overrange or underrange has
occurred. The ADC result is clamped to 0xFFFFFF for overrange errors and
0x000000 for underrange errors. This bit is updated when the ADC result is
written and is cleared at the next update after removing the overrange or
underrange condition.
No error.
Error.
This bit indicates if a CRC error has taken place during a register write. For
register reads, the host microcontroller determines if a CRC error has
occurred. This bit is cleared by a read of this register.
No error.

This bit indicates if the content of one of the internal registers has
changed from the value calculated when the register integrity check was
activated. The check is activated by setting the REG_CHECK bit in the
interface mode register. This bit is cleared by clearing the REG_CHECK bit.
No error.
Error.
These bits are reserved.
These bits indicate which channel was active for the ADC conversion
whose result is currently in the data register. This may be different from
the channel currently being converted. The mapping is a direct map from
the channel register; therefore, Channel 0 results in 0x0 and Channel 3
results in 0x3.

The data register contains the ADC conversion result. The encoding is offset binary, or it can be changed to unipolar by the
BI_UNIPOLARx bit in the setup configuration registers. Reading the data register brings the RDY bit and the RDY output high if it had
been low. The ADC result can be read multiple times; however, because the RDY output has been brought high, it is not possible to know
if another ADC result is imminent. After the command to read the ADC register is received, the ADC does not write a new result into the
data register.

Description
These bits are reserved; set these bits to 0.
This bit allows the ADC to control an external multiplexer, using GPIO0/GPIO1 in sync
with the internal channel sequencing. The analog input pins used for a channel
can still be selected on a per channel basis. Therefore, it is possible to have a
4-channel multiplexer in front of AIN0/AIN1 and another in front of AIN2/AIN3, giving a
total of eight differential channels with the AD7175-2. However, only four channels at a
time can be automatically sequenced. A delay can be inserted after switching an
external multiplexer (see the DELAY bits in the ADC Mode Register section).
This bit enables the SYNC/ERROR pin as a sync input. When the pin is low, this
holds the ADC and filter in reset until SYNC/ERROR pin goes high. An alternative
operation of the SYNC/ERROR pin is available when the ALT_SYNC bit in the
interface mode register is set. This mode only works when multiple channels are
enabled. In this case, a low on the SYNC/ERROR pin does not immediately reset the
filter/modulator. Instead, if the SYNC/ERROR pin is low when the channel is due to
be switched, the modulator and filter are prevented from starting a new
conversion. Bringing SYNC/ERROR high begins the next conversion. This
alternative sync mode allows SYNC/ERROR to be used while cycling through channels.
Disabled.
Enabled.
These bits enable the SYNC/ERROR pin as an error input/output.
Disabled.
SYNC/ERROR is an error input. The (inverted) readback state is OR'ed with other
error sources and is available in the ADC_ERROR bit in the status register. The SYNC/
ERROR pin state can also be read from the ERR_DAT bit in this register.
SYNC/ERROR is an open-drain error output. The status register error bits are OR'ed,
inverted, and mapped to the SYNC/ERROR pin. The SYNC/ERROR pins of multiple
devices can be wired together to a common pull-up resistor so that an error on
any device can be observed.
SYNC/ERROR is a general-purpose output. The status of the pin is controlled by the
ERR_DAT bit in this register. This output is referenced between IOVDD and DGND,
as opposed to the AVDD1 and AVSS levels used by the general-purpose input/
output pins. The SYNC/ERROR pin has an active pull-up in this case.

FILTER CONFIGURATION REGISTER 0
Address: 0x28, Reset: 0x0500, Name: FILTCON0
The filter configuration registers are 16-bit registers that configure the ADC data rate and filter options. Writing to any of these registers
resets any active ADC conversion and restarts converting at the first channel in the sequence.

Description
If this bit is set, the mapping of the filter register changes to directly
program the decimation rate of the sinc3 filter for Setup 0. All other
options are eliminated. This allows fine tuning of the output data rate and
filter notch for rejection of specific frequencies. The data rate when on a
single channel equals fMOD/(32 × FILTCON0[14:0]).
These bits are reserved; set these bits to 0.
This bit enables various postfilters for enhanced 50 Hz/60 Hz rejection for
Setup 0. The ORDER0 bits must be set to 00 to select the sinc5 + sinc1
filter for this to work.
Disabled.
Enabled.
These bits select between various postfilters for enhanced 50 Hz/60 Hz
rejection for Setup 0.
27 SPS, 47 dB rejection, 36.7 ms settling.
25 SPS, 62 dB rejection, 40 ms settling.
20 SPS, 86 dB rejection, 50 ms settling.
16.67 SPS, 92 dB rejection, 60 ms settling.
This bit is reserved; set this bit to 0.
These bits control the order of the digital filter that processes the
modulator data for Setup 0.
Sinc5 + sinc1 (default).
Sinc3.
These bits control the output data rate of the ADC and, therefore, the
settling time and noise for Setup 0. Rates shown as for sinc5 + sinc 1 filter.
